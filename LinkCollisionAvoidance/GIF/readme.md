In this folder there are multiple examples of link collision avoidance. All examples follow the same path but with different initial configurations denoted by "qX", where X denotes the ID of the initial configuration.
The path is followed for each initial configuration at different values of potential field strength: indicated by "gY" where Y is the value of gamma_L.

------

**q1_g0** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q1 with potential field gamma_L = 0.

**q1_g1** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q1 with potential field gamma_L = 1.

------

**q1_g100** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q1 with potential field gamma_L = 100.

**q2_g0** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q2 with potential field gamma_L = 0.

**q2_g1** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q2 with potential field gamma_L = 1.

------

**q3_g0** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q3 with potential field gamma_L = 0.

**q3_g1** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q3 with potential field gamma_L = 1.

**q3_g100** Shows robot following path using initial configuration q3 with potential field gamma_L = 100.
