# Admittance Control for Learning from Demonstration

Kinesthetic teaching of complex tasks becomes easier for the operator with the use of an
admittance controller that adapts to the dynamics of the userâ€™s arm. The taught trajectory
can be then encoded as a Dynamic Movement Primitive and adapt to a change in the
location of the workpieces using pose estimation. This project will involve exploring
admittance control.

The project will contain the following subjects:
- Force (admittance) control
- Dynamic movement primitives
- Pose estimation (optional)
